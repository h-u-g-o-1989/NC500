                  Inverness-shire, also called Inverness, historic county of
                  northern Scotland. It is Scotland’s largest historic county
                  and includes a section of the central Highlands, Glen Mor, and
                  a portion of the Highlands to the north. It also encompasses
                  several islands of the Inner and Outer Hebrides, such as Skye,
                  Harris (part of Lewis and Harris), North Uist, Benbecula,
                  South Uist, Barra, and the Small Islands. Those of the Outer
                  Hebrides (Harris, the Uists, Benbecula, and Barra) are part of
                  the Western Isles council area, and the remainder of the
                  county (including the Inner Hebrides and the entire mainland
                  area) lies within the Highland council area.

                  Mim42 Cairns, stone circles, and brochs (dry stone towers)
                  provide evidence of prehistoric settlement in the county. When
                  the area entered the historical record in Roman times, it was
                  the home of the Picts. Inverness was the capital of the Picts
                  under King Brude when St. Columba arrived about AD 565 to
                  promote Christianity. When Scotland was united in subsequent
                  centuries, Inverness-shire formed part of the province of
                  Moray. The county came under the control of a succession of
                  landowning dynasties during the Middle Ages, including the
                  MacIntoshes, the Frasers, the Chisholms, and the Grants. Along
                  the Atlantic coast the MacDonalds, Camerons, and MacLeods were
                  subject to the Lords of the Isles. During the 15th and 16th
                  centuries, however, the Stuart kings used the influence of the
                  chiefs in the growing clan system to exert control over
                  Inverness-shire.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In the 17th and 18th centuries the county’s clans took
                  different sides in the religious and political controversies
                  surrounding the English Civil Wars and the Jacobite risings,
                  and internecine strife shook Inverness-shire. The British
                  government built Forts George, Augustus, and William and a
                  system of military roads in the county in the late 17th and
                  early 18th centuries to facilitate the area’s pacification.
                  The government reduced the power of the chiefs and cleared the
                  way for acquisition of much of the land by outsiders. These
                  landlords forcibly evicted thousands of crofters (small-scale
                  tenant subsistance farmers) in the “Highland clearances” of
                  the early 19th century to create large sheep-farming estates.
                  Large-scale emigration ensued to the Scottish Lowlands and to
                  Canada, the United States, and Australia. Widespread popular
                  sympathy for the crofters in Scotland brought protective
                  legislation later in the century, but economic hardships
                  caused crofters and other rural inhabitants to migrate to
                  urban areas well into the 20th century. The development of
                  tourism and the exploitation of North Sea oil during the 20th
                  century, however, brought renewed economic vitality to parts
                  of Inverness-shire

                  Ross and Cromarty, historic region, northern Scotland,
                  spanning the width of the country from the North Sea on the
                  east to the Atlantic Ocean on the west. It includes Lewis
                  (part of the island of Lewis and Harris) in the Outer
                  Hebrides.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Ross and Cromarty comprises the historic counties of
                  Ross-shire and Cromartyshire. Ross-shire is the larger of the
                  two counties, including all of Lewis and most of Ross and
                  Cromarty on the Scottish mainland. Ross itself comprises the
                  traditional regions of Wester Ross, on the Atlantic coast, and
                  Easter Ross, on the North Sea coast. Cromartyshire consists of
                  several enclaves scattered across Ross-shire, including an
                  area around the town of Cromarty, and a larger area in the
                  northwest on the border with Sutherland, including the town of
                  Ullapool. Ross-shire and Cromartyshire were merged to form the
                  administrative county of Ross and Cromarty in 1889. Lewis was
                  separated administratively from Ross and Cromarty in 1975, and
                  Ross and Cromarty ceased to be a unit of local government in
                  1996, when the Highland council assumed all local government
                  responsibilities in the area. The mainland portion of Ross and
                  Cromarty, along with a few small islands near the mainland,
                  lies entirely within the Highland council area, while Lewis is
                  part of the Western Isles council area.

                  Stone circles and cairns provide evidence of the area’s
                  prehistoric occupation. By the first centuries AD the region
                  was home to the Picts, who in the 6th and 7th centuries were
                  converted to Christianity by followers of St. Columba. For the
                  next three centuries the region fell under the domination of
                  Norse overlords. In the 12th century Easter Ross was colonized
                  with Flemings, English-speaking Lowlanders, and Anglo-Normans
                  by King David I of Scotland, who wanted to break the power of
                  the local Gaelic chiefs. The earldom of Ross arose at this
                  time. The Gaelic Lords of the Isles dominated the Atlantic
                  coast from the 12th century to the 15th century, when the
                  kings of Scotland secured control over the entire region.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  By the 16th century Ross and Cromarty was occupied by
                  different clans, chiefly the Rosses, Munroes, Macleods,
                  Macdonalds, and Mackenzies. Apart from occasional conflicts
                  among these feuding clans, the only battles were those of
                  Invercarron (1650), when the parliamentary troops of Colonel
                  Archibald Strachan crushed James Graham Montrose’s royalist
                  forces, and Glenshiel (1719), when General Joseph Wightman
                  defeated a small Jacobite uprising led by the earl of
                  Seaforth. The county of Ross-shire was constituted in 1661,
                  and Cromarty became a county in 1698. During the 18th century
                  the government reduced the power of the clan chiefs and
                  cleared the way for acquisition of much of the land by
                  outsiders, who forcibly evicted thousands of crofters
                  (small-scale tenant subsistance farmers) in the “Highland
                  clearances” of the early 19th century to create large
                  sheep-farming estates. Large-scale emigration ensued to the
                  Scottish Lowlands and to Canada, the United States, and
                  Australia. Widespread popular sympathy for the crofters in
                  Scotland brought protective legislation later in the century,
                  but economic hardships caused crofters and other rural
                  inhabitants to migrate to urban areas well into the 20th
                  century. During the late 20th century the development of
                  tourism and the exploitation of North Sea oil brought renewed
                  economic vitality to the area.

                  Sutherland, historic county, northern Scotland. It faces the
                  North Sea on the east and the Atlantic Ocean on the north and
                  northwest, where Cape Wrath, with its magnificent cliffs, is
                  mainland Great Britain’s northwestern extremity. It lies
                  entirely within the Highland council area.

                  Chambered cairns, standing stones and stone rows, hill forts,
                  settlements, and brochs (round towers) are among the
                  prehistoric remains of Sutherland. Successively settled by
                  Picts, Scots, and Norsemen, Sutherland and Caithness (a
                  neighbouring county) were held in the first half of the 11th
                  century by Thorfinn (died c. 1065), the Norse jarl of Orkney,
                  whose mother was a daughter of the Scottish king Malcolm II.
                  The Norse named the area Suðrland (“Southern Land”) in
                  relation to their settlements in Orkney and Shetland. After
                  conquering the region, William I of Scotland (reigned
                  1165–1214) seems to have granted land in Sutherland to a Hugh
                  Freskin, whose son William was probably designated earl in
                  1235.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  George Granville Leveson-Gower (1758–1833), who had married
                  (1785) Elizabeth (countess of Sutherland in her own right),
                  succeeded his father as marquess of Stafford (1803) and was
                  named duke of Sutherland (1833). He was responsible for road
                  building and for the notorious “Highland clearances” (c.
                  1810–20). Advised that the interior of Sutherland was best
                  suited for sheep raising and little fit for human habitation,
                  he evicted thousands of families, burning their cottages and
                  establishing large sheep farms. The evicted tenants were
                  resettled in small coastal crofts (small tenant farms), where
                  they were forced to depend on fishing and the collection and
                  burning of kelp (a source of potash and iodine). The Highland
                  clearances initiated a pattern of rural depopulation in which
                  economic hardship drove many of the crofters to migrate to the
                  Scottish Lowlands or to Canada, the United States, or
                  Australia. The pattern of depopulation continued through much
                  of the 20th century.

                  Caithness, historic county in extreme northern Scotland,
                  facing the Atlantic Ocean and the Pentland Firth (which
                  separates it from the Orkney Islands) on the north and the
                  North Sea on the east. It contains Dunnet Head, the
                  northernmost point in Great Britain, which juts into the
                  Atlantic east of Thurso.

                  <br />
                  The area is part of a plateau about 1,000 feet (300 metres) in
                  elevation in the south, sloping gently north and northeast to
                  the coast, where it is truncated in a series of cliffs up to
                  400 feet (120 metres) high. Above this plateau of old red
                  sandstone and Highland schists rise several massive hills in
                  the south, including Morven, with an elevation of 2,313 feet
                  (705 metres), and Scaraben, which reaches 2,054 feet (626
                  metres). In the north the plateau descends to alluvial plains
                  just above sea level. Fertile glacial deposits and small lochs
                  (lakes) cover the eastern area, and peat bogs predominate in
                  the western two-thirds. Despite its northern latitude,
                  Caithness has a temperate climate.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Caithness is rich in prehistoric remains from Neolithic times
                  onward. Cairns, standing stones, and hill forts abound, and
                  there are more brochs (ancient dry stone buildings) than in
                  any other Scottish county. The area was an early Pictish
                  province called Cait, or Cat, which was invaded by Norsemen.
                  Its place-names testify to Norse domination. Traces of early
                  Christian chapels are widespread, a very early example being
                  St. Mary’s Forse, Thurso. Medieval castles, such as Dunbeath,
                  are found on the coasts; inland castles are usually of a later
                  date.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For a time Caithness was firmly integrated into the Scottish
                  kingdom by William the Lion (reigned 1165–1214), but the Norse
                  earls of Orkney held the earldom of Caithness until 1231. It
                  passed in the Middle Ages to several noble Scottish families,
                  including the Sinclairs and later the Campbells of Glenorchy.
                  The estates were subsequently sold to several Caithness
                  families, including the Traills of Castletown, who encouraged
                  agricultural advances during the 18th century. In the 19th
                  century the county enjoyed a measure of prosperity from its
                  herring industries and the export of flagstones. During the
                  20th century, tourism, fine glass manufacturing, and a nuclear
                  power and research facility at Dounreay supplemented the
                  traditional economy. Wick and Thurso are the most important
                  towns.
