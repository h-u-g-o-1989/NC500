            <h3>The Highland Games</h3>
            <Events1 />
            <CountyInfo>
              <ColumnTwo>
                <p>
                  Scotland has a long tradition of Highland Games where clans
                  would compete against each other in sporting events. Early
                  Celts viewed such events as war games where their strongest
                  and bravest soldiers would win the games.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It is believed that the Highland Games originated as a clan
                  chieftain’s way of choosing the best bodyguards and the
                  fittest fighters. Not all the chief’s requirements were
                  warlike – musicians and dancers were just as important for the
                  prestige of his household. Choosing staff and supporters was
                  done by holding competitions – good runners for couriers,
                  strong men for defence and a range of entertainers to amuse
                  them during the winter evenings.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Many events at today’s Highland Games still use items which
                  would have been part of everyday life in the Highlands of old,
                  for example, round stones from river beds probably provided
                  the original shot-putts whilst a Scots pine trunk shorn of its
                  branches is still the caber as tossed today. Many of these
                  traditions can still be seen in Highland Games today however
                  they are now much more sociable and fun events celebrated
                  worldwide.

                  NC500 MOUNTAIN BIKE TRAILS
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  There’s more to the NC500 than just a road, with some
                  fantastic mountain bike trails and some amazing single-track,
                  there is a variety for the most dedicated riders as well as
                  family friendly routes. We spoke to Lindsey from ShredXS about
                  the Learnie Red Rock mountain bike trails on the Black Isle, a
                  short detour off the North Coast 500. Watch this space for
                  more mtb trails!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Just a short 30 minute drive from Inverness, Learnie Red Rock
                  trails fits the bill for both the expert and family rider.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Heading up from the carpark to the “Y” the first warm up loop
                  is to the left, up the Callachy blue which is a pleasant climb
                  through plush woods, bringing you to the top of the Orange and
                  Callachy Blue down. The Callachy down is wonderful blue route;
                  featuring a few tight berms and some great flowing turns as
                  you reach the bottom. With warmer legs it is now time to head
                  up the “Short blue” to the right, taking you to the top of the
                  trails. Across the single track road there is a wonderful view
                  which look towards Fortrose, Fort George and along thee Moray
                  Firth to Inverness.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A short connecting blue takes you back down the other side,
                  for the “over the back blue” or the gem of the Learnie Black.
                  The recent trail changes, makes even better allowing riders
                  looking for a more technical challenge, some opportunity for
                  bigger air and generally rootie fun.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For the more genteel and family ride a climb up the “Firth
                  view blue” will bring you to the perfect picnic spot, with
                  views south to Moray, over to Nairn and beyond, an ideal spot
                  to enjoy some boat watching and catch your breath – a well
                  named track.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Jumping back on your bike for a quick descent through the
                  whins and the water feature (even in the driest of summers)
                  will lead you back up another small climb to the Learnie
                  trails. A sprint along the fire road and time to finish off
                  with the Orange, with its banked berms, rollers, drops and
                  rock garden working your way back to the start. With a final
                  pleasant green and you’ll find yourself at the car park.

                  Have you heard of Munro Bagging in Scotland? If you haven’t,
                  you will by the end of the article. We caught up with Tim from
                  Hamlet Mountaineering about his favourite Munros and mountains
                  throughout the North Coast 500.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A Munro is a hill in Scotland which is more than 3,000 feet
                  tall, or 914 metres. There are 282 of these wonderful
                  mountains scattered across Scotland, and all of these peaks
                  have their own distinct charm and character.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The North Coast 500 route contains, in my humble opinion, some
                  of the most interesting and beautiful landscapes anywhere in
                  the world. It is these rugged mountains that really bring this
                  sensational landscape to life, giving it depth and life. As
                  you drive around the North Coast 500, take your time to stop
                  and listen to the mountains calling. The Scottish Munros were
                  originally named in 1891 after Sir Hugh Munro – a man who
                  never actually completed the full set! Climbing a Munro stirs
                  something something in the soul; the sore feet, the long boggy
                  walks, the navigationally challenging moments and the cold all
                  seem to fade away to nothing as excitement peaks as you reach
                  the summit and achieve what you set out to do. Not to mention
                  the views; they’re absolutely fantastic.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Throughout the North Coast 500, 37 Munros, 43 Corbetts
                  (mountains of 2,500 feet, or 762 metres) and 38 Grahams
                  (mountains of 2,000 feet, or 762 metres) can be viewed from
                  the winding roads, as well as many marlyns, humps, tumps and
                  simms – yes, people get very into their hill bagging lists! If
                  you want to explore the true beauty and the wilderness of the
                  North Coast 500, you’ll want to get out of the car and get
                  yourself up a hill. Not only will it give you a different
                  perspective on the road, but it also gives you a break from
                  driving and a chance to learn more about what the wilds of
                  Scotland really have to offer. Golden eagles, red deer and
                  ptarmigan are just some of the wildlife you might encounter if
                  you venture off the tarmac strip.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Liathach Ridge: This 7km towering ridge line rises from the
                  sea, dwarfing the village of Torridon. There are two Munros in
                  this maze of pinnacles and rock towers: Spidean a Choire Leith
                  and Mullach an Rathain. Largely considered one of Scotland’s
                  greatest mountaineering days, the ridge offers plenty of
                  scrambling for those that wish to traverse the true ridge.
                  Both Munros at the East and West of the ridge can be gained
                  independently, however the true adventure lies in joining the
                  two.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  An Teallach Traverse: The jagged ridge of An Teallach (the
                  forge) rises above the town of Dundonnell. An Teallach is
                  often thought of as one of the finest Munros in Scotland, and
                  with good reason. Between the two Munros of Bidein a Ghlas
                  Thuill and Sgurr Fiona lies a wonderful puzzle of Torridonian
                  sandstone spires, which the Munro bagger must weave themselves
                  thorough to complete the ridge. Like the Liathach Traverse,
                  both the Munros at either end of the ridge can be gained
                  separately on independent days, without the need to scramble
                  the ridge.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Stac Pollaidh: Not all mountains have to be Munros. Stac
                  Pollaidh is a mere 612 metres, which makes it a Graham. What
                  this mountain lacks in height, it makes up for in character.
                  Stac Pollaidh means ‘pool of the pinnacle’, taken from the old
                  Norse indicating the presence of Vikings in this region at one
                  time. A Torridonian sandstone nunatak which has survived the
                  last ice age, the frost-shattered slopes of Stac Pollaidh
                  provide some of the best rock climbing the country has to
                  offer. But if that’s not your thing and you’re more about the
                  level ground, then a walk around the Stac Pollaidh loop will
                  take you about 3-4 hours on a relatively good path. For those
                  that are all about hitting the true summit, the short ‘bad’
                  step guards the way to the peak. A good head for heights is
                  required here to make a few scrambling moves up a short rock
                  face, which reveals tremendous views out to the Summer Isles
                  and as far as the hills of Harris and the Cuillins of Skye.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Quinag: This fabulous mountain is an icon of the North Coast
                  500 route around Lochinver. The mountain can often appear more
                  like a range when viewed from the side, featuring three main
                  peaks, all of which are classed as Corbetts. At 808 metres,
                  Sail Gharbh is the highest peak capped by 512 million year old
                  Cambrian quartzite. This mountain shows some of the
                  fascinating geology in the UNESCO North West Highland Geopark.
                  Sail Ghorm, at 776 metres tall, is the second highest of the
                  three – a little further out of the way, but well worth the
                  effort for the fabulous views to the sea. Spidean Coinich, at
                  764 metres, is the smallest of the three but it packs a bit of
                  a punch! As you can see in the photograph below, it is rather
                  steep in comparison, and very much a worthwhile outing as
                  you’re passing though.

                  You heard us right the first time ... That's right Axe
                  Throwing. Yes it involves the throwing of axes ... Sharp ones.

                  <br />
                  Axe Throwing is something completely new to the area and an
                  activity we can almost guarantee you won't have tried before
                  but as soon as you do you'll love it. Why? Because it feels
                  naughty. It feels like it's something you shouldn't really be
                  allowed to do...and boy is it satisfying.
